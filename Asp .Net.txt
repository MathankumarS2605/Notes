What is pattern

pattern is the best solution to a recurring problem
architectural pattern(high level solution) and design pattern(low level solution) are the two types of the pattern(Software)

design types : creational pattern , Structural pattern and Behavioural Pattern

Problem in object creation - creational pattern

Problem in association of objects(linking objects) - structural pattern

Problems in invoking methods(behavior) - behavioral pattern

Micrsoft using  many patterns

MVC - architectural pattern(model view controller(view controller, business logic controller)

Design pattern -  IBM (RedBooks),ORACLE

Creational pattern
1.Factory method
2.Abstract factory 
3.builder
4.singleton
5.prototype

Structural pattern
1.proxy
2.Adapter
Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for communication between two independent or incompatible interfaces
3.facade(fazade)
4.flyvate
5.composite
6.broker
7.Decorater

Behavioral pattern
1.commentObject
2.chainOfResponsibility
3.Momento
4.Mediater
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.
5.Observer
6.Template method
7.state
8.stratergy
9.little language
10.visitor
11.Iterator


(external envinronment in which what to use what and when to do it at runtime -- Dependency injection)
Addition to this  IOC or  DI(Dependency injection/inversion of control) --> pattern that not comes under the above type.
