NAMESPACE:

{
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
}

these are used to import the namespaces. 

namespace is a logical grouping thing for .net artifacts(  classes ,interface, Delegates )(ex : //R.yyyy//S.vvvv)
URI Unique Resource Identifier
namespace can have more than one class but each class should have the unique name.
Variable cannot be declare before the namespace .
Variable declaration should be done only inside the class  and also called as Class Variable

Method can only defined in the class.
Global Variable and local Variable name can be same.
Static method only can access the static variables but not non static variable.

Statements cannot be done in the class body but only the variable declaration and method declaration can be done.
A variable that holds the address of the object is called as reference variable.

System.Object Base class to all classes in .net and all class inherits the value from System.Object

four important methods that the child inherits are Equals(object,object),GetHashCode(),GetType(),ToString();(Specilization)

Class

*(_) starts with is a private variable 
*name of the class should be noun name .and of the class should start with uppercase , a class can     be public , internal (friend) classes can be access  by the part of same project. 
*A class must have atleast one constructor.
*A constructor is a very special method . name of the class and name of the constructor have to be the same
*If the programmmer does not provide constructor to the class then the compiler will add a parameter less constructor to the class.(implicitly)
*If parameterized constructor is defined in the class then the compiler will not add the default constructor 
*inner class can also callled as Aggregation.(window and wall ).for existence of objects another object is require then inner class.(Aggregates)
*A class is said to be static does not instantiated 
*static class does not have inheritance
* A constructor said to be  private so that inheritance will occur.
*final in java shield in class which cannot have children .
*Singleton class have only one object.

Members of the Class
 *Fields(Class Variables) 
 *Properties
 *Events
 *Constructors
 *Methods
 *inner classes
 *finalizers

*What is the class? Group of objects share the same symmetic structure is a class there must exists one or more objects.
The process of grouping the objects in a problem statement is called as Classification.
function is a algorithm to solve the problem
Method is a behavior of the objects and not to solve the problem.

4 reasons for application is low 
thread sychronization lock
open and close the file
Socket
Database connection (Polling)

LOC doesn't matter(Lines of Code)

CONSTRUCTOR
*The purpose of the constructor ensure that the object is useable one.(initialisation and instantiation)
*Constructor does not have the return type.
*class is responsible for only one action SOLID 
S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O: Open-closed Principle (OCP)
L: Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Object without any identifier is called as garbage;
attributes means what the object contains.
objects that has no behavior is called as value objects only used for tranfering data like array 

Encapsulation
PolyMorphism - (Compiled)design type polymorphism (OverLoading) and runtime type polymorphism(overriding)Late binding.
Inheritance
Modularity - Packages
Abstraction
